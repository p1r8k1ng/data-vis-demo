Manual Testing
During production, the system was manually tested to ensure functionality, performance, and usability. Key test areas included:
Functionality: Verifying correct data fetching, graph interactions, and filtering.
UI/UX: Checking dynamic updates in the gallery and the accuracy of tooltips.
Performance: Ensuring the system handles large datasets and performs well under load.
Edge Cases: Testing how the system handles missing or incomplete data.

Clicking a marker should update the filter and adjust the network view.  |   The timeline displays markers based on unique artwork periods; tooltips now show detailed labels and numeric years, and clicking a marker successfully triggers a filter update. However, minor clustering issues remain.  |   Pass (with minor issues)  |   Future work will focus on dynamic scaling of the timeline to reduce clustering while retaining chronological spacing.                                                |
|   2025-03-26       |   Media Type Tooltip Enhancement                       |   • Hover over artwork nodes to inspect tooltip content for media type.   • Check if the displayed text is human-readable.                                                    |   Tooltips should display human-readable media types (e.g., “painting”) instead of raw URI strings.                                                             |   The tooltips have been updated to prioritize the English label (dcTypeLangAware.en), resulting in clear and human-readable media types.                                                                                    |   Pass                      |   Commit: “Modified getMediaType function to prioritize dcTypeLangAware.en before falling back to .def”.                                                               |
|   2025-03-26       |   Time Period Bounding Box Layout                      |   • Inspect the arrangement of bounding boxes for time periods in the visualisation using the new angle-based layout.   • Confirm that overlaps are eliminated.               |   Each time period’s bounding box should be placed in a unique slice of the circle (using polar coordinates), preventing overlap.                               |   The angle-based layout successfully assigns each time period a unique slice and eliminates overlapping bounding boxes.                                                                                                     |   Pass                      |   Layout improved via an angle-based mapping using d3.scaleBand() and d3.scaleLinear().                                                                                |
|   2025-03-27       |   Colour Filter Functionality                          |   • Use the color swatches and checkbox selectors to apply a colour filter (e.g., selecting “Blue” and “Black”).   • Verify that the graph redraws with only matching nodes.  |   The color filter should fetch real-time facet values and update the graph dynamically after filter application.                                               |   Colour filter functionality works as expected. On selecting colors, the application refetches data and redraws the network view to reflect the selections.                                                                 |   Pass                      |   Commit: “Added colour filter functionality” implemented on 27/03/2025.                                                                                               |
